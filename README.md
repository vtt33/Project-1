Sub Questions:

1- Do US export trends show a favorable balance of trade for the years covering 2013 â€“ 2018? - Alston Armah

The export trends show an unfavorable balance of trade for the US during the years 2013 through 2018. As shown 
by the trade data, the US experienced a trade deficit of $5,748,578,046,459. How did we derive this conclusion?
Below is a summary of the step-by-step procedure:
i. Clean up data and generate sums of exports and imports for all the six years. Use "=sum" and "=sheet" functions.

ii. Plot the export data in jupyter notebook, using this dataframe:
        'Year': [2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018],
        'Exports': [1578516454556, 1621873476729, 1503327678081, 1451023381497, 1546272800436, 1664054778081],
        'Imports': [2267986733622, 2356356072353, 2248811351481, 2187600097145, 3510159736525, 2542732624713]

iii. Run the code to generate the graph showing the relationship between exports and imports.

2- What countries account for the top five export destinations of the USA? - Toka Hassan

What are the top five importing countries to the USA?

Instructions: Run TopExport.ipynb jupyter notebook for top five export destinations of the USA.

Run TopImport.ipynb jupyter notebook for top five importing countries to the USA.

The results are the top_export_countries.png and the top_import_countries.png

Findings:
China, Mexico, and Canada are the U.S. top trading partners (Imports and Exports)
The other two top exporters are Japan and the United Kingdom.
These five countries combined make up 49.61% of all U.S. exports from 2013-2018.

The other two top importers are Japan and Germany.
These five countries combined make up 58.57% of all U.S. imports from 2013-2018.

**SUMMARY: U.S trades trend deficit to same countries and same categrories (import over export). Suggestion: Increase Exports to Developed Countries, Increase Exports to Local Partners Canada & Mexico (NAFTA), Reduce Imports from China, Reduce Top 5 Import Categories: Electronics, Nuclear, Vehicles,  Fuel, Medical, Encourage Domestic Production & Brand Adoption, ncrease Top 5 Export Categories: Nuclear, Electronics, Fuel, Vehicles, Aircraft.
